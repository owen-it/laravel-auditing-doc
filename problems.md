# Having problems?
If you found or have a problem with this package, let us know!

Bear in mind, however, that nobody likes their time wasted, so before you rush to create a new issue on GitHub, ensure that:
- You have **read** the [Installation](installation.md) and [General Configuration](general-configuration.md) sections of the documentation;
- The issue you're facing is **not** documented in the [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) section;
- A [GitHub issue](https://github.com/owen-it/laravel-auditing/issues) with the problem you're having doesn't already exist (in an open or closed state);

If all of the above applies, feel free to [open a new issue](https://github.com/owen-it/laravel-auditing/issues/new).

Also be aware that filling the [issue template](https://github.com/owen-it/laravel-auditing/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) is **mandatory**!

Failure to do so, will result in a closed ticket.

Abide by these simple terms, and we're all good :-)
